# Driving School Freelance Instructor App üë®üèª‚Äçüè´üöô

This is a project under development to create an app that facilitates and assists in the management of a driving school instructor.

## Technologies
- This application is developed in Flutter, an SDK for cross-platform application development that uses the Dart language. This technology, created by Google, is based on widgets.
- It uses an authentication system and a database implemented with Firebase, along with a local SQL database.

## Project Installation
### Prerequisite Downloads
  - Code editor [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Recommended)
  - [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
  - Android Emulator ([Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=en)) or iOS Emulator ([XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12))
  
### Installation Steps
#### It is recommended to follow the steps and instructions from Flutter's official page to properly configure the code editor and emulators.
- After installing [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install), it is advised to run the command "flutter doctor" to verify that the installation was successful.
- To develop with [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), at least two extensions are required: [Dart](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code) and [Flutter (Extension)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter). These integrate into the development environment.
- These extensions are optional but can be useful in Flutter projects: [Extension List](#vscode-extensions)
- Open the project in VS Code
- In the terminal, execute the command "flutter pub get"
- Press F1 and select [Flutter: Select Device] to choose a connected physical device or a configured virtual device. See [Run Application on Devices](#run-application-on-devices)
- Run the application with F5 or the command "flutter run"

### Run Application on Devices
## Android Devices
 - **Physical Devices**: Connect the device to the computer and enable USB debugging (To activate it for the first time, Developer Options must be enabled).
 - **Virtual Devices**: In Android Studio, under the Virtual Device Manager options, create a virtual device with the desired specifications. (It is recommended to allocate at least 4GB RAM and as much storage space as possible). If the virtual device is running, it will be visible when selecting a device.

## iOS Devices
- **Physical Devices**: Connect the iOS device to the computer. An Apple ID registered with a trusted device is required. Additionally, the device must be set up for development in Xcode.
- **iOS Simulators**: In Xcode, you can select an iOS simulator to run your application. Choose the simulator from the list of available devices in Xcode. Ensure the simulator has the appropriate settings for your needs (screen size, iOS version, etc.).

**Execution**: Once the physical device is connected or the simulator is selected, you can run the application from VS Code by selecting the corresponding device. Use the command "flutter run" in the terminal or run the application directly from VS Code.
